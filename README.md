## Completed Test


### Notes
I have covered most of the requirements for this test but its not 100% complete. For example, the carousel
doesn't automate for mobile however I did allow scrolling and styled up the item tracker. 
My aim was to do as much as possible within three hours, I ended up spending a little longer than
that but happy that I did.

I appreciate the time and effort gone into setting up this test and enjoyed the challenge.
