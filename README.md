# Volvo Cars (Global Online Digital) 
## Completed Test


### Notes
I have covered most of the requirements for this test but its not 100% complete. For example, the carousel
doesn't automate for mobile however I did allow scrolling and styled up the item tracker. 
My aim was to do as much as possible within three hours, I ended up spending a little longer than
that but happy that I did.

I wasn't certain on how the desktop version should scale so to be on the safe side I added a
maximum width constraint of 1024.  Likewise, I tried to maintain the look and feel as the browser 
width reduced.  I then applied new style rules at the mobile breakpoint.  My concern is if this 
ideally needed to scale larger than 1024 then I would have considered using rems or ems. 

I tested the product carousel, and it works but has some edge cases that given more time I would
have developed this more robustly. 

My aim was to tick as many boxes as possible and used your component library which I found
to be impressive.  

I appreciate the time and effort gone into setting up this test and enjoyed the challenge.
